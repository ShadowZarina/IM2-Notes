# The SQL LIKE Operator

The LIKE operator is used in a WHERE clause to search for a specified pattern within a column's text data.
There are two wildcards often used in conjunction with the LIKE operator:
A percent sign % - represents zero, one, or multiple characters
A underscore sign _ - represents a single character
The following SQL selects all customers that starts with the letter "a":
Example
Get your own SQL Server
Select all customers that starts with the letter "a":
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerName LIKE 'a%';

Syntax
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE columnN LIKE pattern;

The % Wildcard
The % wildcard represents any number of characters, even zero characters.
Example
Return all customers from a City that contains the character sequence 'on':
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE city LIKE '%on%';

The _ Wildcard
The _ wildcard represents one single character.
It can be any character or number, but each _ represents one, and only one, character.
Example
Return all customers from a City that starts with 'l' followed by one wildcard character, then 'nd' and then two wildcard characters:
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE city LIKE 'l_nd__';

Starts With
To return records that starts with a specific letter or phrase, add the % at the end of the letter or phrase.
Example
Return all customers that starts with 'La':
SELECT * FROM Customers

Tip: You can also combine any number of conditions using AND or OR operators.
Example
Return all customers that starts with 'a' or starts with 'b':
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerName LIKE 'a%' OR CustomerName LIKE 'b%';

Ends With
To return records that ends with a specific letter or phrase, add the % at the beginning of the letter or phrase.
Example
Return all customers that ends with 'a':
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerName LIKE '%a';
Tip: You can also combine "starts with" and "ends with":
Example
Return all customers that starts with "b" and ends with "s":
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerName LIKE 'b%s';

To return records that contains a specific letter or phrase, add the % both before and after the letter or phrase.
Example
Return all customers that contains the phrase 'or'
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerName LIKE '%or%';

Example
Return all customers that starts with "a" and are at least 3 characters in length:
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerName LIKE 'a__%';
Example
Return all customers that have "r" in the second position:
